# Initial processing of single cell data

Raw data processing is conducted elsewhere <paste link>. The analysis presented in this directory is the tissue-specific processing of count matrices. Specifically, the main goal is to sanity check the pre-processed data. The pipeline is set up to produce a visual report for the tissue-specific experts, and should not require any coding knowledge. The pipeline is highly reproducible and rerunnable with minimal effort, enabling integration of large volumes of pre-processed single-cell data.
