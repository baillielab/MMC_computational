# eQTL mapping strategy

## Project aim & context

The scientific aim of this project is to identify naturally occuring genetic variation in the population that is associated with changes in gene expression in a cell-type or cell-state specific context. Studies have shown `<what have studies shown>`. More specifically, we want to maximize power for detection in this relatively small dataset - we want to identify as many true signals of association as possible.  

## Key decision points

Please see the table below for key decision to be made. 

| Key decision point | Reason this is critical |
|---|---|
|Discrete or continuous cell types | Could greatly change our power of detection? Could also change what we detect? @@@ Need to look into this more|
|How to annotate cell types | Some methods are better than others? @@@ Need to research more |
|How to produce pseudo-bulk measure| some methods are better than others? @@@Need to research more|
|How do we model the continuous cell state | @@@ Need to research more|
